# Overview

- **state_preparation**: main file. It computes the dictionary for standard and optimized Grover Rudolph, it build the permutation for Permutation Grover Rudolph and it counts the gates needed for the algorithms.
- **helping_sp**: collection of helping functions
- - **state_preparation_circuit**: builds the circuit
- **state_preparation_test**: test that the algorithm works correctly 
- **Grudolph_get_data_1**: Stores gate counts in a txt as a function of the sparsity d
- **Grudolph_plot_2**: plots the previous data
